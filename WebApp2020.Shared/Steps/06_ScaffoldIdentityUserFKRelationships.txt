NOTE: If you want to create relationships with the ASP.NET Identity user table, you need to update your model classes with these relationships.

For example, in the Go Movies database, the Booking table has a relationship with the user table (YOUR ASSIGNEMENT DATABASE IS LIKELY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE):
		PK: AspNetUsers table (Id column)
		FK: Booking table (CustomerUserId column)


1. Open up the Bookings.cs class in the WebApp2020.Shared\Models folder

2. Add the following at the top of the file (after the other using statements) to import the Identity and data annotations libraries

		using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
		using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;
		using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;

3. Add the following FK property after the other properties in the class

		[ForeignKey("CustomerUserId")]
        public IdentityUser User { get; set; }

4. Save the changes.

5. In VS, from the main menu go to Tools --> NuGet Package Manager --> Package Manager Console

6. In the window that opens (towards the bottom of the main window), copy and paste the following at the PM prompt:

		add-migration AddFK_OrderDetailsCustomerId -StartupProject WebApp2020.Web -Project WebApp2020.Shared -Context WebApp2020.Shared.Models.WebApp2020DbContext

7. Press the Enter key and be patient. Once done you should see the following message at the prompt: To undo this action, use Remove-Migration.

8. The previous command generates a migration file and this should be open. You do NOT need to do anything to this file.

9. Go back to the Package Manager Console Prompt. Copy and paste the following at the PM prompt:

		update-database -StartupProject WebApp2020.Web -Project WebApp2020.Shared -Context WebApp2020.Shared.Models.WebApp2020DbContext

10. Press the Enter key and be patient. This will know apply the changes to the database. Once done you should see the following message at the prompt: Done.

11. You can check if the FK has been added to the database by:

		From the main menu in VS, go to View --> SQL Server Object Explorer

		Expand the (localdb)\ProjectsV13 server and locate your database

		Locate the Booking table, right-click on the Tables and click Refresh.
		
		Expand the Booking table. Expand the Keys folder and you should see the FK_Booking_AspNetUsers_CustomerUserID

12. One last step. Open up the WebApp2020DbContext file in the WebApp2020.Shared\Models folder.

13. Locate the protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder) method.

		COMMENT OUT the entire method

		Save the file

13. You can close all the files.
