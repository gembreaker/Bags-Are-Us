		a. In the .Web project, locate the Views --> Home folder

		b. Open up the Index.cshtml view

		c. Customise as you wish

2. Change the default MVC route i.e. the default controller and action to load on startup

		a. In the .Web project, locate the Startup.cs file (it is in the main project folder, not a subfolder)

		b. Open the Startup.cs file

		c. Locate the Configure method (usually the last method)

		d. Locate the following block of code:		app.UseMvc(routes => { ... });

				Change this line from:
					
					template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

				To (i.e. change the default controller to the the controller you want to make the default, leave the default action as Index unless you want to make another action method the default):

					template: "{controller=...}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
