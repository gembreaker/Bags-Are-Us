This step will Scaffold ASP.NET Identity i.e. create the Model classes and database tables for ASP.NET Identity (API that supports login functionality)
See more: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity

1. Open up the WebApp2020DbContext file in the WebApp2020.Shared\Models folder

2. Add the following at the top of the file (after the other using statements) to import the Identity library

		using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
		using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore;

3. Replace the folllowing class definition line 
			public partial class WebApp2020DbContext : DbContext
	
	with the following

			public partial class WebApp2020DbContext : IdentityDbContext<IdentityUser>

4. Locate the protected override void OnModelCreating (ModelBuilder modelBuilder) method 

5. Add the following at the start of the method before the other code in the method (make it the first statements)

			// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39798317/identityuserloginstring-requires-a-primary-key-to-be-defined-error-while-addi
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);

5. In VS, from the main menu go to Tools --> NuGet Package Manager --> Package Manager Console

6. In the window that opens (towards the bottom of the main window), copy and paste the following at the PM prompt:

		add-migration Scaffold-AspNetIdentity -StartupProject WebApp2020.Web -Project WebApp2020.Shared -Context WebApp2020.Shared.Models.WebApp2020DbContext

7. Press the Enter key and be patient. Once done you should see the following message at the prompt: To undo this action, use Remove-Migration.

8. The previous command generates a migration file and this should be open. Go to the file.

		The file includes commands to create all the tables in the database but we don't want it to recreate our existing tables.

		IMPORTANT: comment out the blocks of code, i.e. migrationBuilder.CreateTable(...), to create the following tables:
			AgeRating
			Booking
			BookingTicket
			Film
			FilmShowing
			TicketType

		ALSO: comment out the blocks of code to create indexes on the tables above, i.e. migrationBuilder.CreateIndex(...)

9. Save the file.


10. Go back to the Package Manager Console Prompt. Copy and paste the following at the PM prompt:

		update-database -StartupProject WebApp2020.Web -Project WebApp2020.Shared -Context WebApp2020.Shared.Models.WebApp2020DbContext

11. Press the Enter key and be patient. This will know apply the changes to the database. Once done you should see the following message at the prompt: Done.

12. You can check if the ASP.NET Identity tables have been added to the database by:
		
		From the main menu in VS, go to View --> SQL Server Object Explorer

		Expand the (localdb)\ProjectsV13 server and locate your database

		Right-click on the Tables and click Refresh. You should see the new AspNetUser tables.
