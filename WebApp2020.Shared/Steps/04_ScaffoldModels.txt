Scaffold DbContext and Model Classes to the Models folder
This step will create the Model classes and DbContext (class used by ASP.NET to connect to the database) files


1. In VS, from the main menu go to Tools --> NuGet Package Manager --> Package Manager Console

2. In the window that opens (towards the bottom of the main window), copy and paste the following at the PM prompt:

		Scaffold-DbContext "Server=(localdb)\ProjectsV13;Database=WebApp2020;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -StartupProject WebApp2020.Web -Project WebApp2020.Shared -OutputDir Models -Context WebApp2020DbContext

3. Press the Enter key and be patient

4. Once done you should see the new files generated in the WebApp2020.Shared\Models folder.
